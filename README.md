# RhoPollard
This code is a python algorithm using Pollard's Rho method to find collision in any hash function. Moreover it uses the ![Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare) to optimize the search. A whole study had been conducted by myself in 2021 : ![See the paper](https://devnathan.github.io) (free and in french 🇫🇷)🇷

## Usage
#### 1 - Clone the project
Clone this project on your laptop by using this [link](https://github.com/DevNathan/RhoPollard/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or by executing the following command in your terminal :
```
git clone https://github.com/DevNathan/RhoPollard
```

#### 2 - Generate collisions
Generate a collision on a hash function : 
```Python
import RhoPollard
hash_method = hashFunc() # Must be func which takes one argument, the clear message and returns the corresponding hash.
len_randWord_max = 1000 # Maximum length (in char) of the random word generated by Pollard's Rho algorithm

rho_pollard = RhoPollard(hashFunc, len_randWord_max)

(clear1, clear2, nb_hash) = rho_pollard.main() # The called func returns the two clears message in collision and the number of hashes generated.
```
